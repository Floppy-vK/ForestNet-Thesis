# ForestNet-Thesis
This repository contains all the code used for writing my thesis, _Testing the effectiveness of alpha blending in deforestation driver classification_. The dataset used for this project can be found at https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/forestnet.

## Contributions
All the notebooks except image_conversion.ipynb are adapted from forestnet-segmentation_original.ipynb. This notebook was downloaded from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/code/oscarsommervold/forestnet-segmentation/notebook), and created by Oscar Sommervold. The code was changed to accept the newly generated images which one can create by running select parts of image_conversion.ipynb.
